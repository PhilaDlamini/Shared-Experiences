An HTTP Server and a GUI Application

Shared Experiences is a platform that enables multiple users to watch the same movie simultaneously on their respective devices, with shared control over video playback. 
Once a group of users joins the same session, each user can control the video playback (e.g., pausing, skipping, playing the video) and text each other while watching.

Technologies:
HTTP Server: Written in C
GUI: Built with JavaFX
